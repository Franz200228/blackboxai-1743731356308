# Waste Management System

## Project Overview
The Waste Management System is a web application designed to help users manage their waste efficiently and promote sustainable practices. The application offers various features such as user registration and login, a dashboard with collection schedules, recycling tips, and the ability to report waste-related issues. Through this system, users can stay informed about their waste disposal schedules and learn how to participate in environmentally friendly practices.

## Installation
To set up the Waste Management System on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd waste_management
   ```

2. **Set up a database:**
   - Create a new MySQL database called `waste_management`.
   - Update the `config.php` file with your database credentials if necessary.
   ```php
   $host = 'localhost';
   $db   = 'waste_management';
   $user = 'root'; // update if necessary
   $pass = ''; // update if necessary
   ```

3. **Set up a web server:**
   - Ensure you have a local web server (like Apache or Nginx) installed and running.
   - Place the project files in the web server's document root or configure the server to point to the project directory.

4. **Access the application:**
   - You can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost/<project-directory>/index.php` in your web browser.

## Usage
- **User Registration:** New users can create an account by clicking on the *Register* link and filling out the registration form.
- **User Login:** Existing users can log in using their registered email and password.
- **Dashboard:** Once logged in, users can view their dashboard containing collection schedules and helpful recycling tips.
- **Logout:** Users can log out at any time using the logout link.

## Features
- User registration and authentication
- Dashboard with collection schedules and recycling statistics
- Informative recycling tips
- Ability to report issues related to waste management
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS for a modern look

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following libraries:
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons
- PHP 7.0 (or higher) with PDO extension for database connectivity
- MySQL database

```

### Additional Note
Make sure to handle sensitive data, such as passwords, securely by hashing them before storing them in the database (this is done using `password_hash()` in the registration process). Always validate and sanitize user input to protect against SQL injection and other attacks.

## Conclusion
The Waste Management System aims to facilitate effective waste management practices while encouraging users to be more involved in sustainability efforts. This project can be extended with additional features such as notifications for collection days or tracking individual recycling habits in greater detail.
